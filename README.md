# warriors-and-dragons
First project with React + Redux -- do battle between warriors and dragons!


An interactive game board:
-
Add warriors and dragons by name.

Attack warriors and dragons with calls to a mock AttackAPI for various weapons and tactics.

Destroy a warrior's armor to render him/her unconscious.

Capture a wild dragon who's been sufficiently weakened.

Bury slain warriors, scatter the ashes of deceased dragons, and start fresh.
